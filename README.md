# AI-Chatbot-EduBot_V1

* This project is based on NLP and deep neural networks.
* I have used frequently asked questions and answers data from SASTRA DEEMED TO BE UNIVERSITY's website to train EduBot_V1.
* First the data is made into a json file containing different tags(categories), Questions and Replies.
* Then the data is converted to bag of words format and fed to the neural network along with the tags as output.
* Then input is taken from the user and preprocessed into same bag of words format and fed to the network and predicted probablities for different tags is obtained.
* The replies stored under the tag with highest predicted probablity is shown as reply to the user randomly.
* The project is not complete yet. I will update with more detailed write up once this is complete.
